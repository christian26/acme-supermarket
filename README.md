STYLED-COMPONENTS

JSS is a more powerful abstraction over CSS. It uses JavaScript as a language to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. 
It is a high performance JS to CSS compiler which works at runtime and server-side. This core library is low level and framework agnostic.
It is about 6KB (minified and gzipped) and is extensible via plugins API. — source

REDUX

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to
test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.


##npm install --save redux
